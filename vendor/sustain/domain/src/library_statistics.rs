//! Pure aggregation over the in-memory track list — which is the
//! authoritative SQLite copy the rest of the app already holds, so these
//! figures never re-read file tags. The presentation layer renders the
//! returned struct; every selection rule (top-N folding, weighted
//! "most liked" ranking, zero-star exclusion, decade
//! bucketing) lives here so it can be tested without a UI.
//!
//! Two time domains appear: a track's *release year*
//! (`TrackMetadata::year`) is already a calendar year, so it is bucketed
//! arithmetically; the *date a track was added* is a [`SystemTime`] whose
//! calendar year requires a timezone-aware calendar this crate
//! deliberately does not depend on. Callers pass a `year_of_added`
//! closure (the GTK frontend backs it with `glib::DateTime`) so the
//! bucketing rule still lives here while the calendar dependency stays at
//! the edge.
