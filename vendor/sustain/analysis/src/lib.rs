//! Audio analysis for Sustain — pure DSP, no I/O beyond reading the
//! audio file the caller hands us.
//!
//! [`Analyzer`] is the single public surface: a stateful,
//! capability-driven analyzer that owns a single track and caches the
//! decoded audio shared between bands. Callers pick exactly which bands
//! they want by calling [`Analyzer::bpm`], [`Analyzer::key`],
//! [`Analyzer::acoustics`], and [`Analyzer::waveform`] independently —
//! a method that is never called does zero work. This is the API the
//! background scheduler uses, so toggling off (say) waveform generation
//! in Preferences actually skips the waveform decode pass.
//!
//! ## Analysis windows
//!
//! BPM and key are read off a **centered** window — the middle
//! `BPM_KEY_WINDOW_SECS` of the track — not the opening seconds. The
//! intro of a track (especially electronic music) is the least
//! representative part: sparse, tame, often beatless. The middle is
//! where the groove and the tonal centre actually live. The window is
//! seeked to, so even on a long file we never decode the lead-in.
//!
//! Tracks are tiered by length to keep the working set bounded:
//!
//! * **Normal** (≤ 15 min, `LONG_TRACK_THRESHOLD_SECS`): acoustics
//!   measure the whole track (so the loudness guard's short-term max
//!   sees a real finale, §7), and the waveform renders the whole track
//!   at full detail.
//! * **Long** (> 15 min — classical movements, DJ mixes, podcasts):
//!   acoustics measure a centered `ACOUSTICS_LONG_WINDOW_SECS` sample
//!   instead of the whole track, and the **waveform is skipped
//!   entirely** (the caller checks [`Analyzer::is_long_track`]). A
//!   whole-track decode of a two-hour file is gigabytes of working set
//!   for a feature that, at that length, is a coarse smear nobody
//!   scrubs; the high-detail, device-specific waveforms a Pioneer
//!   export needs are computed on demand by that export, not here.
//!
//! The windows nest — the BPM/key window is always the centre of the
//! acoustics window — so when `audio` analysis is enabled the acoustics
//! decode is computed once and BPM/key slice their window out of it for
//! free. BPM/key requested *without* audio decode only their own
//! centered window.
//!
//! The Analyzer composes the vendored `sustain_dsp` primitives directly
//! (chroma extractor for the STFT, period tempogram for BPM, key detector
//! for key). The vendored core is deliberately just those primitives: it
//! omits the upstream `analyze_audio` compute-everything orchestration,
//! which always computes every band, so calling it for "BPM only" would
//! still pay for chroma + key detection. The trade-off is that we forgo
//! that orchestration's confidence-boosting heuristics (multi-resolution
//! tempogram, onset consensus); accuracy on a 200-track validation set was
//! measured at ~85% with the plain tempogram path versus ~92% with the
//! full orchestration. The maintainer's call is that 7 percentage points
//! is the right price for an honest skip path.
//!
//! Persistence, paced scheduling, and "needs analysis" bookkeeping
//! live in `sustain-library-store` and `sustain-app-runtime`
//! respectively. This crate touches the filesystem only to read the
//! audio file.

/// Monotonically-increasing identifier for the DSP algorithms in this

/// `track_analysis` rows. The storage layer compares stored rows
/// against this value to decide whether a track should be re-queued
/// by the runtime scheduler — no migration code, just a version
/// bump that the scheduler walks past in the background.
///
/// Version 2: the BPM and key bands now route through
/// `stratum_dsp::features::*` directly via [`Analyzer`] instead of
/// `stratum_dsp::analyze_audio`'s compute-everything orchestration, so
/// previously-attempted rows must be re-attempted under the new
/// capability-driven pipeline.
///
/// Version 3: the audio pass gained the perceptual acoustic feature
/// set (loudness, onset density, timbral band ratios, low-band
/// variation, tonalness) Smart Shuffle consumes. Tracks attempted under
/// version 2 have no `track_acoustics` row, so they must be re-attempted.
///
/// Version 4: BPM/key moved from the opening 120 s to a *centered*
/// window, and long tracks (> 15 min) now measure acoustics over a
/// centered 8-min sample with the waveform skipped. The values these
/// produce differ from version 3, so previously-attempted rows must be
/// re-attempted. Note the storage layer's `FILL_*_IF_NULL` policy: a
/// re-attempt overwrites acoustics but leaves an existing BPM/key value
/// in place (it never clobbers a populated field), so an existing
/// library only picks up the new centered BPM/key on a wipe-and-rescan
/// — the documented pre-release workflow.
///
/// Version 5: waveform detail windows are laid out on the exact Pioneer
/// half-frame timeline (150 entries per second), including for sample
/// rates that are not divisible by 150.
///
/// Version 6: the key detector can now select minor keys. Through version 5
/// it normalized the major and minor template-match scores by their own
/// separate maxima before comparing across modes, which (because the
/// templates are L2-normalized) tied the top major and top minor candidate
/// and the tie-break always picked major — so it never output a minor key on
/// real audio (#192). A single shared-maximum scaling restores honest
/// cross-mode comparison; key outputs change for any track that is actually
/// in a minor key, so previously-attempted rows must be re-attempted. (Per
/// the `FILL_*_IF_NULL` policy noted under version 4, an existing populated
/// key is only replaced on a wipe-and-rescan.)
///
/// Version 7: the key detector now scores with mean-centered (Pearson)
/// correlation — the actual Krumhansl-Schmuckler metric — instead of a raw
/// dot product against the L2-normalized profiles. The raw dot product
/// correlated against the baseline energy real polyphonic audio spreads
/// across every pitch class, which systematically favored the denser minor
/// profile and made the detector predict minor for ~98–100% of real tracks
/// (#192); centering both the aggregated chroma and the profile removes that
/// bias. Measured across GiantSteps Key, FMAK, and a private set, major-track
/// MIREX roughly tripled (≈6–10% → ≈25–32%) while minor-track accuracy
/// regressed only moderately, so key outputs change for many tracks and
/// previously-attempted rows must be re-attempted (subject to the same
/// `FILL_*_IF_NULL` wipe-and-rescan policy as above).
///
/// Version 8: key detection now runs on its own dedicated STFT
/// (`KEY_STFT_FRAME_SIZE`, 8192-point) instead of reusing the 2048-point
/// tempogram STFT. The tempo frame's ~21.5 Hz bins cannot separate
/// adjacent semitones below ~360 Hz, smearing the low-register harmonic
/// energy chroma depends on; the 8192-point frame's ~5.4 Hz bins resolve
/// semitones down to ~90 Hz. Scoring, profiles, and the chroma mapping
/// are unchanged — only the spectrogram feeding chroma is finer — but the
/// chroma, and so the detected key, change for many tracks, which must be
/// re-attempted under the same `FILL_*_IF_NULL` wipe-and-rescan policy.
///
/// Version 9: key detection now runs a median-filter
/// harmonic-percussive separation (`emphasize_harmonic`, `KEY_HPSS_*`) over
/// the key STFT before chroma, attenuating percussive/broadband energy that
/// otherwise spreads across every pitch class and dilutes the profile. Only
/// the spectrogram feeding chroma changes — STFT, scoring, profiles, and the
/// chroma mapping are all unchanged — but the chroma, and so the detected key,
/// shift for many tracks, which re-attempt under the same `FILL_*_IF_NULL`
/// wipe-and-rescan policy. BPM is untouched.
///
/// Version 10: key detection now builds its pitch-class profile with a core
/// Harmonic Pitch Class Profile (`compute_hpcp`) instead of the vendored
/// band-summed chroma. HPCP derives the profile from the spectrum's *peaks* —
/// spectral peak picking with quadratic (QIFFT) interpolation, energy
/// weighting, and a squared-cosine pitch-class window — so the noise floor
/// between partials no longer dilutes the profile. The HPSS front-end, the STFT
/// size, the `[100, 5000] Hz` band, the 440 Hz pitch-class grid, and the entire
/// detector (templates, mean-centered Pearson, cross-mode rescale,
/// circle-of-fifths bonus, L2 normalization) are all unchanged — only how the
/// spectrogram becomes a chroma vector. The detected key shifts for many
/// tracks, which re-attempt under the same `FILL_*_IF_NULL` wipe-and-rescan
/// policy. BPM is untouched.
///
/// Version 11: the HPCP front-end adds harmonic summation — each spectral peak
/// now also credits the pitch classes of its first eight *subharmonics*
/// (`freq / h`, decayed by `0.6` per harmonic), folding overtone energy back
/// onto the fundamentals it could belong to. This counters the systematic v10
/// leak whereby a tonic's 5th harmonic (its major third) inflated the
/// major-third bin and biased minor-key audio toward the parallel major. Only
/// the chroma mapping changes — HPSS, STFT, band, grid, peak picking, energy
/// weighting, window, and the entire detector are unchanged. The detected key
/// shifts for some tracks, which re-attempt under the same `FILL_*_IF_NULL`
/// wipe-and-rescan policy. BPM is untouched.
///
/// Version 12: the HPCP front-end estimates the recording's tuning before
/// binning — the energy-weighted circular mean of every peak's deviation from
/// the 440 Hz grid — and re-references every pitch class to it, so audio
/// mastered or recorded off concert pitch is no longer smeared across two bins.
/// The estimate is parameter-free and self-zeroing (already-on-grid material is
/// left untouched). Only the chroma mapping changes — HPSS, STFT, band, peak
/// picking, energy weighting, window, harmonic summation, and the detector are
/// unchanged. The detected key shifts for some tracks, which re-attempt under
/// the same `FILL_*_IF_NULL` wipe-and-rescan policy. BPM is untouched.
///
/// Deliberately *not* gated here: the audio *decoder* library version.
/// The symphonia 0.5 → 0.6 migration changes some lossy-format (e.g. MP3)
/// decoded samples slightly — enough to shift waveform/acoustics and,
/// rarely, a BPM estimate — but the band split, BPM/key engine, and
/// waveform encoding (the things this version actually gates) are
/// unchanged, and PCM/WAV decode is bit-identical. Re-deriving every
/// existing library's audio pass for sub-perceptual decoder rounding would
/// be disproportionate, so the decoder migration does not advance this
/// version on its own: existing rows keep their values; only
/// newly-analyzed tracks use the 0.6 decode.
///
/// Likewise *not* gated: the #192 vendoring of the BPM/key/STFT/onset/loudness
/// DSP out of the published `stratum-dsp` crate into `sustain-dsp`. The
/// vendored full-band path reproduces the previous BPM/acoustics/waveform
/// byte-for-byte on the synthetic corpus, so stored values' meaning is
